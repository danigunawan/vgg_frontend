macOS Sierra v10.13.3
---------------------

**NOTE: The macos installers for `VIC` no longer work because homebrew now installs openssl@1.1 (see https://brew.sh/2019/11/27/homebrew-2.2.0/) when installing the dependencies of `VIC`. This brakes the compilation of `cppnetlib` and makes the installation very difficult. However, the installers are kept here for reference of advanced users who whish to venture into it.**
